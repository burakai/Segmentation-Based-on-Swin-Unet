## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Swin-Unet model, a state-of-the-art architecture developed for accurate and robust medical image segmentation tasks. This model combines the power of the Swin Transformer, originally designed for computer vision tasks, with the U-Net architecture, widely used for semantic segmentation. The fusion of these components enables the Swin-Unet model to effectively capture spatial dependencies and extract high-level features from medical images, leading to precise segmentation results.

## Model Overview

The Swin-Unet model consists of two main modules: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder module utilizes Swin Transformer blocks, which employ multi-head self-attention layers and feed-forward neural networks. These components allow the model to capture interdependencies between image pixels and learn meaningful representations, crucial for accurate segmentation. The decoder module focuses on recovering spatial resolution and refining feature representations, leveraging skip connections between corresponding encoder and decoder layers to enhance segmentation accuracy by combining local details and global context.

## Training and Inference

During training, the Swin-Unet model is optimized using a suitable loss function, such as the Dice loss or cross-entropy loss, to measure dissimilarity between predicted segmentation masks and ground truth labels. The model adjusts its parameters through backpropagation, minimizing the loss and improving segmentation performance. Once trained, the model can be deployed for inference on unseen medical images, generating segmentation masks that accurately identify and delineate target structures or regions of interest.

## Usage

To train the Swin-Unet model on your own data or reproduce our experiments, follow the instructions in the `code/README.md` file. The `data/README.md` file contains details on the datasets used, and the `models/README.md` file provides guidance on how to load and evaluate the trained models.

## Results and Conclusion

Our experiments have demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the Swin-Unet architecture for brain tumor segmentation when applied to preprocessed data. While our original intention to use the model with multimodal MRI images faced challenges, we successfully adapted the model with preprocessed data provided by TransUnet. Future work can explore the use of other medical image segmentation frameworks, such as nnUnet, to compare their performance on the BRATS challenge dataset.

We hope that this repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of medical image computing, advancing the development of robust and reliable segmentation methods and improving patient care in neuro-oncology.
